I don't remember the exact source, but I think it was from the American Housing Survey (AHS) from some year in the past. I found some data and processed it into a format appropriate for this kind of competition.
It's not the exact same thing, but roughly the same data source as the Adult dataset which some of you might be familiar with (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult and https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset). But I think a different year.
